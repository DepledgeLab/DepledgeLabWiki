MkDocs allows so called \"themes\" to change its appearance (and behaviour). It contains only few themes from the get-go, but there are many independent ones. Materials for MkDocs started out as such a third party theme and since evolved into a full framework itself. The installation of MkDocs is still neccessary though.</p> <p>This Wiki (which is essentially the collection of all its files and folders) is hosted on GitHub and deployed through GitHub Pages (using GitHubs automatic Action workflows)(1)).

The schedule is organised by Erik - feel free to contact him in case of questions, comments, suggestions etc. This is how our weekly meetings work:</p> <ul> <li>We (try to) meet on every Monday, 14:30, in the Seminar room (J06-06).</li> <li>To keep it a bit interesting, we are rotating between 4 different formats across the weeks. These include:<ul> <li> <code>Individual Presentations</code><ul> <li>One person presents the progress of their current work. Discussions, questions and advice is encoured.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <code>Journal Discussions</code><ul> <li>Similar to a journal club, but without a single, dedicated presenter</li> <li>In advance, one paper will be chosen as the paper for the resepective Monday Lab Meeting. For that, papers can be suggested by everyone (and cleared by Dan). The chosen paper will be added to our papers-please collection and marked as such.</li> <li>As mentioned, there is no individual presenter, instead we will discuss our thoughts and questions on said paper together (for this, everybody will need to read the paper). There will however be 1-2 people (rotating) leading the discussion.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <code>AMAs (Ask Me Anything)</code> <ul> <li>An open question session dedicated to a specific topic</li> <li>In advance, one specific topic will be chosen (e.g. Nanopore DRS). Before the meeting we will give this topic some thought and collect questions we have about it/ read up on some details if we are knowledgable in that topic.</li> <li>In the meeting, we then try to awnser each others questions (obviously, often Dan will be doing a lot of the awnsering, but that is O.K.)</li> <li>Feel free to suggest specific topics you would like to discuss</li> </ul> </li> <li> <code>General meetings</code><ul> <li>General lab topics, dates etc. are discussed</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>In case of deviations from the schedule, Erik will send out a message to inform about the changes. You can always check the current schedule at the page you are currently at</li> </ul> <p>Should you have ideas for other formats feel free to make suggestions. :)</p> <p>As we are still testing these new formats and getting a feel for them they might not yet be perfect, but we are postiive we will get there!
