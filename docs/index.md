## The purpose of this Wiki
This wiki is the central documentation hub of the DepledgeLab at the Hannover Medical School (MHH), Institute of Virology.

It means to be the home of important protocols, scripts, bioinformatical methods, guides and much more! DepledgeLabWiki aims to - over time - create a reference point for present and future researchers of AG Depledge to write down, share, explain and retain acquired knowledge.
It is also written with the intent to inform collaborators about the details of AG Depledges work.
