As members of participating universities (e.g. the MHH), we have access to the service provides through AcademicCloud - for free. Each employee or student automatically also has an AcademicCloud account. Services include, but are not limited to, Chat AIs like  ChatGTP-4, 50 GB of cloud space, GitLab, LaTeX editors etc. It's very helpful, so give it a try!
