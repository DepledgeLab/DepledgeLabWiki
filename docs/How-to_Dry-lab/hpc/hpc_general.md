Whenever we do Science&#x2122; we often find ourselves with data on our hands. Often, these data also want to be anlysed in one of many different ways. Sometimes, this works perfectly fine with our institute issued computers or our trusty laptops. But occasionally (or frequently, depending on what you are working on) this just doesn't cut it. The calculations are too slow, data too large, software too difficult to install and results annoying to share.<br>
But do not fret! Because this is exactly what the HPC is here for you!<br>
<br>
Like many other institutions, the MHH too has it's own **H**igh **P**erfomance **C**omputing (**HPC**) Cluster, called 'leine' (named after the river [Leine](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leine_(Aller)) that runs through Hannover). This allows you to run computationally heavy tasks quickly and in the background on the server, instead of a local machine. Applications can reach from sequence basecalling, to analysing single-cell data in sever-provided RStudio sessions, up to training ML models.<br>
<br>
The following pages give you a bit of an overview on how the HPC works and how to effectively utilise it.
