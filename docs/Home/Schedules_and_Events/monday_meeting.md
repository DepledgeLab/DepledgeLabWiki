!!! warning "Work in progress"

    This Wiki (and the webpage) are currently under construction, many parts still have an unfinished look / just contain filler content.<br>
    The Monday Lab Meeting schedule is correct though.<br>

## The new Monday Lab meeting explained

(For the moment just the message I sent to you)

Hello everybody and Happy New Year from me, too :D!
As some of you may have already heard, with the beginning of this year I will now be responsible to organise the Monday Lab Meetings, which previously Elene did (thanks! :)).
In the coming days I will send you the first schedule for the next weeks. The first meeting of this year will be on January, 20th.
But first I'd like to inform you about some of the changes we plan to do to the Monday Lab Meetings. Instead of having someone present their progress (alomst) every single week, we now plan to rotate through (~4) different formats every week.
These are the formats we came up with (not necessarily in this order):

1. Individual presentation
    1. This is the format from the previous meetings we already know, one person presents their work.
2. Journal discussion
    1. Similar to a journal club, but without a single, dedicated presenter
    2. In advance, one paper will be chosen as the paper for the resepective Monday Lab Meeting. For that, papers can be suggested by everyone (and cleared by Dan). The chosen paper will be added to our papers-please collection and marked as such at (https://sync.academiccloud.de/index.php/apps/onlyoffice/s/jEqtZdjGY1d84fT?fileId=569377339).
    3. As mentioned, there is no individual presenter, instead we will discuss our thoughts and questions on said paper together (for this, everybody will need to read the paper). There will however be 1-2 people (rotating) leading the discussion.
3. AMA (Ask Me Anything)
    1. An open Question session dedicated to a specific topic
    2. In advance, one specific topic will be chosen (e.g. Nanopore DRS). Before the meeting we will give this topic some thought and collect questions we have about it/ read up on some details if we are knowledgable in that topic.
    3. In the meeting we then try to awnser each others questions (obviously, often Dan will be doing a lot of the awnsering)
    4. Feel free to suggest specific topics you would like to discuss
4. General meeting
    1. This format we also already know. Here, general lab topics, dates etc. will be discussed.

Additionally, if you have ideas for other formats feel free to make suggestions. :)

To test these new formats, I have scheduled the next 8 meetings, this way we get 2 coomplete cycles and can evaluate how it went.
