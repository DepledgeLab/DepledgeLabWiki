    This Wiki (and the webpage) are currently under construction, many parts still have an unfinished look / just contain filler content.<br>

## The new Monday Lab meeting explained

Above you can find the current schedule for the AGDepledge Monday Meeting. This meeting broadly entails all members of AG Depledge, as well as individual members from other research group at the Institue of Virology (MHH). The schedule is organised by Erik - feel free to contact him in case of questions, comments, suggestions etc.
This is how our weekly meetings work:

- We (try to) meet on every Monday, 14:30, in the Seminar room (J06-06).
- To keep it a bit interesting, we are rotating between **4** different formats across the weeks. These include:
    - <span style="color:plum">:octicons-person-24:</span> `Individual Presentations`
        - One person presents the progress of their current work. Discussions, questions and advice is encoured.
    - <span style="color:seagreen">:material-newspaper-variant-multiple:</span> `Journal Discussions`
        - Similar to a journal club, but without a single, dedicated presenter
        - In advance, one paper will be chosen as the paper for the resepective Monday Lab Meeting. For that, papers can be suggested by everyone (and cleared by Dan). The chosen paper will be added to our [papers-please collection]((https://sync.academiccloud.de/index.php/apps/onlyoffice/s/jEqtZdjGY1d84fT?fileId=569377339)) and marked as such.
        - As mentioned, there is no individual presenter, instead we will discuss our thoughts and questions on said paper together (for this, everybody will need to read the paper). There will however be 1-2 people (rotating) leading the discussion.
    - <span style="color:orange">:material-account-question:</span> `AMAs (Ask Me Anything)` 
        - An open question session dedicated to a specific topic
        - In advance, one specific topic will be chosen (e.g. Nanopore DRS). Before the meeting we will give this topic some thought and collect questions we have about it/ read up on some details if we are knowledgable in that topic.
        - In the meeting, we then try to awnser each others questions (obviously, often Dan will be doing a lot of the awnsering, but that is O.K.)
        - Feel free to suggest specific topics you would like to discuss
    - <span style="color:royalblue">:octicons-comment-discussion-24:</span> `General meetings`
        - General lab topics, dates etc. are discussed
- In case of deviations from the schedule, Erik will send out a message to inform about the changes. You can always check the current schedule at [the page you are currently at](https://depledgelab.github.io/DepledgeLabWiki/Home/Schedules_and_Events/monday_meeting/)

Should you have ideas for other formats feel free to make suggestions. :)

As we are still testing these new formats and getting a feel for them they might not yet be perfect, but we are postiive we will get there! A review of these formats in ~March would probably be sensible.
