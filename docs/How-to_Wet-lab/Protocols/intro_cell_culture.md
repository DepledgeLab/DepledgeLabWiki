The ability to grow cells *in vitro* has been central to biomedical discovery for the past century. While cells in a dish have adapted to their new environment and are not identical to cells *in vivo*, many of the basic cellular processes remain intact. 

^^Primary cells^^ are cells taken directly from an animal or tissue and put into a dish.  Cells are classified as a ^^cell line^^ as they are passaged *in vitro* such that they become more homogenous, with the cells with the highest growth potential predominating.  Cell strains are derived from cell lines that have undergone selection process. 

### Sterile Technique
The biggest challenge to cell culture is keeping cells from becoming contaminated with fungus or bacteria.  The nice nutrient-rich media provided to the cells is very attractive the microbes in the air and on our hands.  Wear gloves at all times.   Always work with cells in the tissue culture hoods.  These hoods provide filtered air and reduce potential contamination.  Before beginning work in the hood, be sure to spray down all surfaces (including your gloved hands) with 70% ethanol.  Minimize things coming in and out of the hood, and be sure to spray down any bottles or equipment coming in and out with 70% ethanol.  Open and close dishes carefully, and leave caps on bottles as much as possible. If you work with viruses, use incidin (for enveloped viruses) or optisept (for non-enveloped viruses) - make sure you spray the bottles & racks when you take them out of the hood and disinfect the hood bench after you’re done working. 

### Media
Different cell types have different nutritional, hormonal, and adhesion requirements in order to be grown in vitro.  Most cell lines, are adhesive cells that will grow right on plastic dishes with no special extracellular matrix being provided for it.  Most cells are grown in DMEM – Dulbecco/Vogt Modified Eagle’s Minimal Essential Media but other media such as RPMI, DMEM/F12 or specialized keratinocyte media for example can also be used.  It contains amino acids, salts, glucose, and vitamins, and iron, and we add sodium pyruvate, L-glutamine, Pen-Strep and usually 8% fetal bovine serum is added (aliquots in freezer). Keep the media in the fridge. Make sure to label them with your initials, date, and whether or not they have any supplements. Unlabeled bottles will be discarded. All unopened media bottles of our group are stored in the 4°C room (Room #2280).

### Tissue culture hood calendar
Make sure you book the hood for the duration you need it as early as possible. If you see on the calendar that no one is going to use it after you, close it down and make sure that all the other devices in the lab – microscope, centrifuge, water bath, cell counter are turned off & all the lights are switched off.

### Thawing Cells
Cells are frozen in either media containing a higher percentage of fetal bovine serum or pure serum with 5-15% DMSO.  The DMSO is important for lowering the freezing temperature of the cells, which allows for a slower freezing process.  This slow freeze keeps ice crystals from forming and puncturing the cell membrane.  The DMSO can also be toxic to the cells, though, so they should be removed from the media with DMSO quickly.  


### Thawing Cells (Cont)

1.	Take cells from the liquid nitrogen and put them into a water bath. 
2.	The cells should be shaken gently within the water bath to expedite thawing (the goal is to thaw the cells within a minute or so).
3.	Immediate dilute the cells in pre-warmed media in a 15 ml conical tube.
4.	Put the tube in the centrifuge the cells at 1200 rpm for 5-15 minutes.  (Make sure the centrifuge is balanced!)
5.	Aspirate off the media containing the DMSO, being careful to not disturb the cell pellet at the bottom.
6.	Re-suspend the cells in an appropriate amount of media.
7.	Plate the cells in the appropriate dish.  
8.	Gently push the cells back and forth and then left and right in order to ensure even distribution of the cells.
9.	Place the cells in an incubator at 37 degrees with a CO~2~ level of 5%.
Note: Some companies/cells may require seeding of cells with DMSO and removing the diluted DMSO the next day rather than spinning the cells first.

### Passaging Cells
Once cells become confluent, many are growth inhibited and their general physiology can be altered.  Most cell lines should be passaged once the cells reach confluence so that they do not become quiescent, and will continue dividing and growing.   Adherent cells need to be dissociated from the dish.  Trypsin is an enzyme that will lyse the proteins that connect the cells.  It works best at 37°C and is inactivated by the serum in media.  Write the cell type, passage number, your initials and date on the dishes and freezing vials when freezing. Preferably cells should not be continuously passaged for more then 30-35 passages depending on the cell type. Primary cells usually cannot be passaged more then 15-20 times.  

1.	Remove the growth media.
2.	Wash the cells once with PBS to remove any remaining serum.
3.	Add 1ml of 0.5% trypsin with EDTA to a 10 cm dish of cells.
4.	Put the dish into the incubator for 1-5 minutes.  (Different cell types will take different amounts of time to be trysinized.)
5.	After one-three minutes, check the cells under a microscope to see that they are rounded. Shaking the dish should cause the cells to detach and float.
6.	Add media with serum (approximately 9 ml).
7.	Dilute the cells by adding 1-2 ml of the trypsinized cells into new dishes containing 8-9 ml of fresh media. Alternatively, count the cells using the Countess and seed a specific amount in desired vessel. Check useful cell numbers for cell culture in protocol folder for estimates of seeding amount for different vessels.

### Freezing Cells
Most cells can be frozen in fetal bovine serum with 10% DMSO.  As explained in the thawing section, DMSO lowers the freezing temperature of the cells, slowing freezing and helping prevent ice crystals.  The cells should be put in the freezer as soon as they are in contact with the DMSO, though, because the DMSO can be toxic to them.  The vial of cells should also be put in a Mr. Frosty freezing container to further slow the freezing process. Usually freeze around 1x10^6^ cells per vial.

1.	Follow steps 1-6 in the Passaging Cells section of the protocol.
2.	Put one plate of detached cells into a 15 ml conical.
3.	Centrifuge the cells for 3 minutes at 1200 rpm.
4.	Aspirate the media, being careful to not disturb the cell pellet.
5.	Resuspend pellet in appropriate amount (0.5-1x10^6^ cells/ml) FCS containing 10% DMSO or 10% DMSO, 30% FCS in media.
6.	Put the 1.5 ml of cells into a freezing vial.
7.	Wrap the tube in paper towel and put into a Styrofoam container or other freezing container.
8.	Put the container in a -70 freezer for 1 day.
9.	Cells should then be moved to a liquid nitrogen tank for long-term storage.
