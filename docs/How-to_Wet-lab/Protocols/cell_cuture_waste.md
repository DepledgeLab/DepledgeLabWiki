- After working in the hood, check whether you should dispose of the small waste bag in the hood and put it in the big waste bucket.
- If you are working with viruses, put all the waste (tubes, pipette tips, etc.) in the small waste bag.
- If the bag/bucket is 75% full dispose of it!
- Tape the bag up before taking it out of the hood. 
- For the big waste bucket, add some water to the bucket tape the bag shut and put it in the autoclave at once. If the autoclave is already running you can leave it in the lab.
- For liquid waste: use the vacuum pump to suck up any waste. If you want to pour your flasks into a falcon tube first then suck up the waste from the falcon tube at the end when you are finished working in the hood.
- The vacuum pump has to have some korsolex-extra in the bottom of the bottle before you start using it.
- Do not overfill the vacuum pump bottle.
- When 75% full the bottle needs to be autoclaved, there is a spare bottle that can be put in place. Place the bottle lid closed in an S2 waste bucket to carry it over to the scullery.
- Open the lid of the bottle slightly before autoclaving
