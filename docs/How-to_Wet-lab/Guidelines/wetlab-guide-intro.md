## What you need to know

### :material-tshirt-crew-outline: Labcoats

- S1 labcoats can be found in the cupboard next to the secretary office in the hallway
- S2 labcoats can be found in the cupboard next to the scullery

### :fontawesome-regular-trash-can: Waste disposal

- Normal lab waste containers
    - Do not overfill, the lid still needs to fit
    - Fold the bag shut, take it to the scullery, put a bit of water in the bottom and put it in the autoclave

- Chemical waste in the S1 chemical hood
    - Liquid waste in the chemical hood: See `AGDepledge:\Protocols\Waste containers.docx` for 
    - Solid waste: Goes in the plastic bag after evaporation, tied shut and put in the blue chemical bin next to the hood. Do not close until full.

- S2 waste containers vs. solid waste
    - See `AGDepledge:\Protocols\Golden Rules for Disposal of Cell Culture Waste.docx`
    - Solid waste: Use the S2 buckets (they have lids with a bigger edge). Bags need to be closed with tape. Do not overfill! Take the bucket to the scullery, put a bit of water in the botoom and put it in the autoclave.

- Normal waste and recycling
    - See `AGDepledge:\Protocols\Waste-management.pdf`

### :fontawesome-solid-sheet-plastic: Stock Room for plastics

- The stock room for plastics (tips, pipettes, dishes etc.) can be found in the rear hallway
- The chemiclas (Ethanol, Methanol, Isopropanol etc.) are stored in room 2242 (key required)

### :fontawesome-regular-snowflake: Storing samples in -80Â°C and liquid nitrogen

- Label items and boxes
- Add them to the database:
    - `AGDepledge:\Databases\-80C freezer database.xlsx` or
    - `AGDepledge:\Databases\Liquid nitrogen tank cell storage`

### :fontawesome-solid-toolbox: Training required - Equipment

- If you want to use a piece of equipment and you don't know how, check if there is a note on or near it to see who to speak to.
- Otherwise ask Dan, Ruth, Michael or Jens Bohne (who is also the manager for biological safety)

### :material-server: How to Leine & AGDepeldge-Drive

- To see how to use Leine and the AGDepledge drive, and how to store/backup data, see `AGDepledge:\Bioinformatics resources\Intro to HPC course`
